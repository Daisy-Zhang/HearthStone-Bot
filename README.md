# HearthStone_Bot
A HearthStone bot based on GUI operation with specific deck.

# About the parameters
This code is mainly based on GUI operation, by imitating mouse's click and move to play the game as a bot, so different computer may have different parameters, the parameter.txt is based on 13.3 inch and 1440 * 900 screen. If you want to use this bot, you may need to get your compuer's relevant parameters.

# About the function this code achieve
This code is very easy to read, you can figure out what it has achieved just by scanning quickly, mainly including check turn, pass turn, play minions, minions attack, use hero power, taunt policy, judge win or lose. Yes, it doesn't have many functions, but i think those functions are enough for a simple bot.

# About the decks which can used by this bot
Now that we know all the functions this bot has achieved, you can see that this bot just supports minion and those cards witout choosing a target. Many spells, finding and battlecry are forbidden. So those hunters like following are the best choices :)
